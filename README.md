# Thinkpad X201 ACPI Scripts

Setting up this laptop to run with XMonad I had issues with the gnome power manager and began my dive into managing most of the machine's power functions myself. To my dismay most of these scripts are very archaic and many are completely unnecessary for my needs. This project is seeking to rework these scripts so that they make sense to me, and are custom to this machine.

They are probably wrong in a lot of ways, and they're are definitely wrong for many other people's machines. But so far my minor changes seems to be working for me.
